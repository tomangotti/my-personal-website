            <h1>Hello World!</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Thomas Angotti and this is my story. I am from Clarksburg, West Virginia, I lived there untill I graduated college from 
                West Virginia University with a Bachelors of Science degree in Civil Engineering. Once I graduated in 2016 I then moved to Denver, 
                Colorado which is where I have called home for the last 6 years. Shortly after moving here I started working as at Rocky Mountian 
                Prestress. I work there for a few years when Wells Concrete bought us and I continued working with them.
