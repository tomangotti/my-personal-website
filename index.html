                My name is Thomas Angotti and Welcome to my personal Website. 
                I am originally from West Virginia but moved to Denver CO just 
                over 6 years ago. I moved here for work and stayed for the mountians.

                Yes, I decided at the age of 30 would be the best time to make a career change. 
                All jokes aside, after 6 years in the construction industry working as both a 
                QC Inspector and a Design Engineer I decided to make a change into the Software world.
